<p>This place is very beautiful. It's got cute little brightly painted houses on a sandbar of an island. But the thing that's most beautiful is the wildlife in the ocean.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to living on land too. You're pretty much fish in a bucket for people who want to sell you things, and that can get pretty annoying. The english here, isn't exactly english. I thought that being in Belize, it would be relatively easy to communicate with the locals, but no. It's perhaps harder than in a second language, because here, you both purport to be speaking the same language to begin with.</p>

<p>Anyway, Matt and I got some diving done while we were here, and it was lovely.</p>
