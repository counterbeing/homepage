      <description>Address already in use Damn. Did I leave a server running somewhere? Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re not sure where you left a server running, or where something is running you never knew about. I&amp;rsquo;m finally writing this down, as I always have to look it up. I found this solution in a StackOverflow post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get all of the processes by what port they&amp;rsquo;re using.
sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P As A Shell Function Looking at it, I realized I would never remember it, given how infrequently I need it.</description>

Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re not sure where you left a server running, or where something is running you never knew about. I&amp;rsquo;m finally writing this down, as I always have to look it up. I found this solution in a StackOverflow post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get all of the processes by what port they&amp;rsquo;re using.
sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P As A Shell Function Looking at it, I realized I would never remember it, given how infrequently I need it. So, I wrote a function. You should be able to pop this into your .bashrc or .zshrc, or whatever you&amp;rsquo;re using.
function whats_using { if [ -z $1 ]; then sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P else sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P | grep $1 fi } Now you can search for what&amp;rsquo;s using a port like so, or don&amp;rsquo;t specify a port number to return all results.
