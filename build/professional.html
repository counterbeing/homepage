             <p>This was a tool that I decided I needed. I looked around at various applications that were intended for the purpose but was generally dissatisfied at the primitive templating.<br />
As a programmer, when you do something more than once, you begin to think of ways to automate it. This project began as that, but now I'm beginning to wonder if I'll be able to turn it into a sellable product.<br />
The initial goal was to create a super slick interface that revolves around real time updating of data by using Angularjs resources, as well as a live templating preview that includes all the functionality  of Handlebars. The flexibility within templates gives you conditionals and loops for writing templates that are robust, and completely reusable.</p>

             <p>This was a unique challenge, and a really fun project. I'm actually a partner with this company, and we've been having a blast making cool emoji for people to text with.</p>

<p>This project involved some original thinking because we needed to find a way to distribute our emoji without there being a store that already existed to sell them. So, we had to create our own custom workflow to both sell, and use the product.</p>

<p>I did everything from the coding for the rails app, to all of the infrastructure management, and server scaling.</p>

             <p>This project started with an aging filemaker database. The goal of the project initially, was just to make the old database work. But then we took a good look at what the organization really wanted, and it was more than FileMaker would reasonably offer.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before we were working on a project that would allow the organization to collaborate on this piece of their business, as never before. They no longer needed a person to type and retyple the same thing over and over again. We used nested models to elinate loads of redundant work.</p>

<h2 id="languages-and-frameworks">Languages and Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ruby and Rails</strong>: <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="A highly opinionated application framework">Rails</a> was originally what got me into <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" title="A fantastic programming language.">Ruby</a>. Initially I found Ruby tough to follow, being used to less civilized languages (I'm looking at you PHP). But one day a switch was flipped, and I loved it.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: I remember the days I cursed JS. I just didn't understand why it had to work the way it did. But, once jQuery and other frameworks made JS feel so much more manageable, I jumped back on board. And now we see all sorts of new uses for it.</li>
  <li><strong>Front End Frameworks</strong>: I'm developing a new passion for front end frameworks. Currently my focus is on <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="A JavaScript framework to give information structure.">Backbone.js</a>, and I'm awestruck with all the potential it holds. It's clear that this is part of the future, and it's not hard to explain why. I often find myself at a middle ground using something like <a href="http://sammyjs.org/" title="A simple framework, kind of like sinatra, but for the browser.">Sammy.</a> On smaller projects that are starting to resemble a spaghetti monster.</li>
  <li><strong>Information Technology</strong>: For the past several years, I've been managing a fleet of Mac computers using <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" title="A system management tool.">Puppet</a>. I can't say I always love the organization of puppet, but I am constantly amazed at what it's capable of, and all of the man hours it has saved.</li>

<h2 id="what-ive-done-so-far">What I've Done So Far</h2>

<p>I started out doing web design just out of high school. That was many years ago now. It was a scary and exciting time living on my own and working on my own for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>After a couple of years of working on my own on various small projects, I met up with <a href="http://www.maccentricsolutions.com">MacCentric Solutions</a> and began working in IT with them. There were many helpdesk tasks at the beginning, but after a few years of that, I started to loop back around to coding. Rails was all the rage at the time, and I became very excited about it and started to take on jobs on the side.</p>

<p>Eventually, I realized I didn't want to be in IT any more, and moved into a development role. And here I am.</p>

<h2 id="whats-up-next-the-things-i-want-to-work-on">What's Up Next? The Things I Want To Work On</h2>
<p>I've done a pretty good job of working on things that I want to. Right now, my current goal is to work on a SAAS product. I think it's a really good business model. I just need to do some exploration in some markets that I love.</p>

<p>While this is a common and somewhat nebulous sentiment, I feel the strong desire to have my work help people.</p>
