<p>The ride into Lima was spectacular in places, but boring in a couple. The descent from the mountains was too much fun to stop for a photo.</p>

<p>I was surprised at how nice Lima seemed. It was actually rather clean. Granted, I was in the nicest neighborhood as far as I know, but regardless, there were very few rough edges. I had some good food, and got on my way. I only wish I had made it to the San Francisco church.</p>
