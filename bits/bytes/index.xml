      <description>Note: If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a server already, check my last tip.
This topic is always a little tricky, so, here&amp;rsquo;s the basic thing to know, as this is the most frequent use case.
Suppose you have a development rails server running on your local computer. You can access this server via curl http://localhost:3000. Which is to say, it&amp;rsquo;s running on your localhost, on port 3000. You want your client to see it, to give you feedback, but they&amp;rsquo;re nowhere near you, and you just want a quick way to show it to them.</description>

      <title>Exporting A Zone File From Mediatemple</title>

      <description>I was in the process of moving my DNS from MediaTemple to Route53 and was having trouble making sure I&amp;rsquo;d moved all of the entries. I decided I&amp;rsquo;d just export a zone file to do a comparison in a text editor.
Surprise! You can&amp;rsquo;t.
Instead, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick bit of jQuery, which is already available in the MediaTemple control panel. Just navigate to the zone file editor, open your console, and use this:</description>

      <title>Reducing The Size Of Alpine Docker Images</title>

      <description>Why the heck is my alpine docker image so huge? That&amp;rsquo;s a tough question to answer, especially when you have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s taking up all of the space.
This is a dirty little one-liner that yields a sorted list of all of the packages on your alpine image by size. It does this by
 Getting the complete list from apk info Iterating over the results to ask apk for its size Removing the blank lines Combining the size lines and the name lines Sorting by size  apk info | while read a; do apk info -s $a; done | awk NF | sed &amp;#39;Ns/\n/ /&amp;#39; | sort -k4 -n  It may be ugly, but now I can make an informed decision about wether or not there are binaries that can be axed.</description>

      <description>Address already in use Damn. Did I leave a server running somewhere? Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re not sure where you left a server running, or where something is running you never knew about. I&amp;rsquo;m finally writing this down, as I always have to look it up. I found this solution in a StackOverflow post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get all of the processes by what port they&amp;rsquo;re using.
sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P  As A Shell Function Looking at it, I realized I would never remember it, given how infrequently I need it.</description>
