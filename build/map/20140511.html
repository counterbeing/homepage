<p>Once again, I thought I was on a roll. I thought I would be in Chile before the week was out, but I snapped a couple of bolts, and vibrated another free on the ride to Sucre. All this due to about a hundred miles of cobblestone and dirt. It was apparant that some work needed to be done on the bike before moving on.</p>

<p>Fortunately, someone recommended a really nice hostel with some friendly folks that let me park in the courtyard and work on the bike. Took a good bit of time to hack off a couple of bolts to get the box off. The two remaining bolts were so bent that I couldn't remove them as intended. I had to take parts off of the bike to bring them to a welder to get them extracted. Then it was only about five more stops to get all of the necessary parts. I have to say, I'm pleased with the results, but it was a reail pain to get it done.</p>
