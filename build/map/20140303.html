<p>Today started out with a walk to find some SOAT (motorcycle insurance). I discovered I could only buy it in year increments in San Ignacio, and that just would not do, because it was rather expensive. After departing San Ignacio late because I was trying to deal with insurance, I ended up at a road blocked for construction with a bunch of guys.</p>

<p>It's a regular party whenever there's construction around here. Everyone gets out of there cars and buys snack from a few local vendors with a tarp structure set up to block the sun. I was told I would be sitting there baking for 20 minutes, so I got off the bike and had a chat. Everyone agreed that the only place to pick up insurance was Chiclayo. I decide then and there to change course. I wanted to get insurance so I didn't have to worry about police, I've heard they can be a real pest. Additionally, I like to respect the laws of the country I'm in… Except for the dumb ones, like speed limits of around 20  mph on open road with nobody around. And most important of all: I wanted some of this ceviche I've been hearing about.</p>

<p>The ride was stunning. Somehow running in that direction you cross the mountain range, and it results in a glorious cross section of Peruvian climates. I'm sure it's a geologist's wet dream.</p>

<p>The whole time I was slightly concerned about running into police, without insurance I was asking for trouble. Most likely someone would want to be bribed.</p>

<h2 id="peruvian-soat">Peruvian SOAT</h2>
<p>Getting my SOAT was no easy thing due to where I crossed in. I ended up having to go to Chiclayo to get it. I just wanted to share a bit on how that went.</p>

<p>Part one is finding a place to sleep that can store a motorcycle. Here's one that treated me nicely and was pretty cheap. It's called Aurora's and there's a photo below: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/6%C2%B045'51.5%22S+79%C2%B050'26.5%22W/@-6.76432,-79.8407,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Aurora's Hostel">map</a>.</p>

<p>And here's <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/6%C2%B046'23.2%22S+79%C2%B050'18.2%22W/@-6.77312,-79.8384,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0" title="SOAT Seller">the place I got my SOAT</a> for 45 days. It took a few minutes, and cost about $50 USD which I thought was quite steep.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>While in the shower a moment ago, I started thinking about some of the things that I've learned on this trip, whilst stooping to pick a bar of dropped soap up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every time you use a bar of soap, it is a new bar of soap.</li>
  <li>Shampoo is way overrated… <a href="http://www.whitneyfreedman.com" title="Thank you Whitney">Some natural oil in your hair can be stylish</a>, and when it is dirty, you <em>can</em> wash your hair with a bar of soap.</li>
  <li>You can wash underwear in the sink, and with good conditions have them be dry in in the morning.</li>
  <li>Motorbiking everywhere gives you awesome street cred.</li>
  <li>A large rock could fall on you at any time, so live it up.</li>
  <li>The sun will always find the shortest path to your nose: put sunscreen on it.</li>
  <li>Police can smell fear, and detect body language, even through a motorcycle suit. You're not guilty, don't look guilty (even if you are a little guilty).</li>
  <li>The most important aspect to speaking a new language is confidence – act like you know what you're talking about, and you probably do.</li>
  <li>Police have a life too… Playing dumb really can get you a long way, as long as you're willing to swallow your ego.</li>
  <li>When asking to take someone's photo, don't feel weird about it, or they'll feel weird about it.</li>
</ul>
