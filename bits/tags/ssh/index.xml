      <description>Note: If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a server already, check my last tip.
This topic is always a little tricky, so, here&amp;rsquo;s the basic thing to know, as this is the most frequent use case.
Suppose you have a development rails server running on your local computer. You can access this server via curl http://localhost:3000. Which is to say, it&amp;rsquo;s running on your localhost, on port 3000. You want your client to see it, to give you feedback, but they&amp;rsquo;re nowhere near you, and you just want a quick way to show it to them.</description>
