## TLDR
 Choosing a text editor is a very personal decision. You grow with your editor, as your editor grows with you. As I use my text editor more and more over the years, I'm constantly constantly learning new techniques for working more efficiently. Some of them stick, others are forgotten. I find that sequences and shortcuts that I most use stay. But just as importantly VIM accomodates my changing needs through configuration, plugin, or otherwise.

Different jobs require different tools

I actually keep a couple of GUI editors around as I find that have uses for them. There are some tasks that mice are just really good at. TextWrangler works well with really large files. Sometimes I might just it to look at a gigantic CSV alongside the code that's being used to manipulate it. 

Vim also has it's own set of advantages. It's very fast at large search and replace operations. It's infinitely extensible, with plugins that integrate with git, automatically format tables, check syntaxj. It can be operated entirely over SSH. It's easily customized. It's ubiquitous. It's free. It has a great communit of people.

- Steep learning curve.
- Customization is almost requisite
- Not everyone knows how to use VIM, this can be and impediment to working with someone else at your computer.


## Better, Faster, Stronger

Vim is brilliant in how extesible and malleable it is.
