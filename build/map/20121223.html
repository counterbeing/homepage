<p>Made it back down to Dana Point where I got to see my mother, and loads of friends and their families. I dinnered at the Smith estate. I got a little bit of work done on the motorcycle, and managed to install a USB charger for my phone.</p>

<p>I got to attend a few Christmas celebrations with the families of my friends, and it was very relaxed and nice. I spoke with a lot of folks about my trip. While there I didn’t really have any feelings towards my trip. It felt as though I wasn’t tied to any particular place, and that life was just going on as normal. It was really odd not having my logic align with my emotions. That’s nothing new.</p>

<p>On the next to last day I got a little bit unlucky. I was cleaning the visor on my motorcycle helmet when one side of it snapped. It was still operational, but it wasn’t secure, and it’s a very important component in terms of being able to see anything. My heart sank immediately. I called Tony at SF Moto, who had originally sold me the Shark helmet. I was in luck. Not far off of my path was the only Shark distributor in the entire US. The only catch was, the shortest route to get there was Ortega Highway. I’d always heard of Ortega Highway as being popular for motorcyclists. I took it, and saw why. It’s quite a gorgeous road with tons of turns and elevation change. It was a bit cold, but my heated grips were serving me well.   The distributor was named Bill, and he took good care of me.  He warrantied the old visor and gave me a new one on the way. He informed me that someone else was about to take care of US distribution in a few weeks time, everything would be moved to Texas. It turned out I was luckier than I knew.</p>

<p>I was back on the road again. I stopped at a McDonald’s for breakfast because  I knew I was short on time. I talked with a man, and told him about my plans. He admired them. It’s somehow confidence building to tell someone about the trip, so I gave him the story in the most romantic words possible… in a McDonald’s parking lot.</p>

<p>I was back on the road again. I could already see some wear on my rear tire. I wasn’t even 1000 miles into the trip yet. The roads in California, Arizona, and New Mexico all have high speed limits. Wanting to make good time during daylight (because of how cold the nights are) I pushed it harder than I would have liked. My bike starts to burn some oil at around 5K rpm (About 70mph). On a 500 mile leg cruising over 70mph I can get through the better part of a Liter of oil. That was a bit nerve-wracking.  Motorcycle oil is specific to motorcycles for a reason. It doesn’t have some of the friction modifiers that are present in car oil for a couple of reasons, having to do with a clutch that’s operated while soaked in oil, and also lubricating the transmission. I know that finding motorcycle oil south of the border will be a bit more of a challenge than on this side.</p>
