It&#39;s fairly remote, with a fair bit of dirt road required to get there. But on the other hand, it has it&#39;s more gringofied neighboring towns. I didn&#39;t actually stay in Nosara, I was in a smaller town called Playa Garza.</p><p>I stayed in <a href="http://sunandwaveshotel.com/">a hotel in playa garza</a>, but because it was low season, they rented me an apartment longer term. So, I stayed for a month. It was a fantastic, small little room, but it had two beds in it, and a little kitchen. It really had everything I needed, and I was quite content there. There was almost nobody around. The occasional guests would come through. Some people would come to the restaurant for dinner, or some nights they just wouldn&#39;t, and that was great for me too.</p><p>We&#39;d rig up the projector and put a movie on many evenings. Some days, I would get to go surfing at a nearby beach. Life was pretty good. Towards the end I got a slight bit of the ol&#39; cabin fever, but up to that point, it was lovely for me.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3777/11252718926_6ace191317_c.jpg" alt="Lookout View"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5512/11252725504_7a8c78fa42_c.jpg" alt="Crazy Cat"><figcaption>This little lady was constantly playing, and great to have around.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3757/11252727284_157b1b3876_c.jpg" alt="Salad"><figcaption>I'm a bit proud, cabbage, garbanzo, avocado, with a lime dressing.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/11252780793_1d86a5cd9a_c.jpg" alt="Salad"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/11252730534_48795167ce_c.jpg" alt="My kitchen"><figcaption>The kitchen in my room.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3711/11252726856_64d4000484_c.jpg" alt="My kitchen"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/11252734324_ea1e0517d2_c.jpg" alt="IMG_1053"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/11252787533_8b7a6a71e1_c.jpg" alt="My Apartment"><figcaption>Slept here for the month</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/11252705655_5a5914d41f_c.jpg" alt="Juri"><figcaption>My hilarious Italian friend Juri.
