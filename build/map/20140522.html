<p>Well, if you read my last post, you know it finally happened. I broke down. I can't say I'm terribly surprised, it was a perfect storm of a rich carb, high altitudes, and shitty gasoline that I think did me in. Somehow though, I landed in a good place, and with friendly people that were willing to help me.</p>

<p>My time here hasn't been terribly interesting. The food in general, isn't terriffic, and is expensive. I spend a lot of my time at my hotel, reading or trying to get work done.</p>

<p>So, after pulling the head off, it appears I burnt a valve. I'm not sure what the total bill is yet, but we'll start at about $300 in parts.</p>
