It&#39;s hot during the day, not bad by night. Near where I stayed were countless dive bars, and small restaurants. It is worth noting that it&#39;s surrounded by some beautiful scenery, some plains and mountains. But on the whole, not much of a tourist destination. I was certainly the only gringo that I came into contact with, which was kind of a nice change of pace.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/11239399694_91f6563a3e_c.jpg" alt="Aguachica"><figcaption>Very nice ride with views of mountain ranges, greenery, and small towns.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/counterbeing/sets/72157638415163084/show" title="The flickr set">the original files on flickr</a> in a slideshow.</p><br><div class="map-nav"><a href="#20131127_colombia_minca" title="previous post" class="button scripty">&lt; Previous</a> <a href="#20131129_colombia_bucaramanga" title="next post" class="button scripty">Next &gt;</a> <a href="/index.html" title="homepage" class="button">Homepage</a></div><footer>by Cory Logan</footer></div></body></html>
