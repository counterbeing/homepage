## Overview of Goals

### Self Sufficiency & Minimalism

I wish to be off the grid. I wish to be able to cook, and store food. I wish to have a place to work on my computer, free from distraction. 

### Mobility

I'd really like to move around a lot. I have some exploring to do in the entire Western North America. I can imagine spending some time in Portland, Seattle, Santa Fe, Austin, many national parks, and maybe all the way up to Vancouver. I have no qualms with heading east as well, I just want to be sure everything is mechanically sound first. 

### Social Gatherings

Hanging out at the beach.

### Active Lifestyle

I would like space for storing all of my climbing gear. In a perfect world, this bus would carry me and climbing freinds to climbing destinations, and make camp life exceptionally comfortable. 

I would like to keep a surfboard on board. With some luck, I could spend some time parked near a surfable beach.

A bicycle would be necessary, as driving a bus short to medium distances doesn't make sense most of the time. I think this would be a very positive addition to my lifestyle. 

## Electrical Accessories

These are the items I wish to be able to run any time I please.

- Interior LED lighting. (5-20 watts depending upon which lights are on)
- [Low Wattage Refridgerator for Solar Power](http://sundanzer.com/solar-power-refrigerators/upright-combination/) (90Â°F - 720 Whrs/day, 60 AH/day)
- Computer Monitor (About 40 watts)
- Laptop (About 40 watts)
- iPhone Charger (About 5 watts)
- A reasonable soundsystem

## Electrical System

### Goals

I would like to be able to be 100% off the grid. Though a bit expensive, I'm most interested in the solar route. This will also mean I need a means of storing energy, and will also have to be pretty selective about what I choose to power. 

I would like the flexibility to charge by plugging in as well. Sometimes it might be useful, especially when doing work on the bus itself. It would be an added perk to have the system take excess electricity from the alternator when the engine is running. 

### Components

These would include everything from charging to storage. [A kit](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Solar-Panel-400W-Mono/dp/B00BSZUHRC/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_2_1) might be the route I end up going, but I'm going to list the separate pieces.

- Solar panels (Probably around 400 watts)
- Deep Cycle Batteries 
- 

### Consumption and Capacity

From what I've been reading these calculations, as well as the calculations for charging time are somewhat fuzzy. They will be a bit different every day based on what I'm doing, and what the weather is doing. I will of course wish to produce more electricyity thank I plan to consume. 


## Kitchen

### Stove

1 to 2 propane burners should suffice. I would like to use standard propane tanks that can simply be replaced at most any gas station. I would probably have a small backup cannister in the even that i ran out of fuel unexpectedly. 

### Sink

Simple kitchen sink, with no greywater tank. I would simply use a bucket.

## Bathroom
I have no plans for a proper shower, as I just don't think the space is worth it.
I am most interested in the possibility of a [composting toilet](http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Head-Composting-Toilet-Standard/dp/B003EX7LV6/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top). 

## Problems that need Solutions

- Where can I work on it?
- Where can I legally park it long term and short term.
- Insurance. Will it be crazy?
