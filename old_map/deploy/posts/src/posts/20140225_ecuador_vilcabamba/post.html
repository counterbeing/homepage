The entire ride I was dodging rocks the size of pit bulls on the road.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/12904253885_765c766528_c.jpg" alt="Friendly Folk"><figcaption>This isn't the first time someone has stopped to ask to get a photo with me, but this time I asked them to take one with my phone as well.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7372/12904261705_eefa1a697e_c.jpg" alt="Charles"><figcaption>One funny frenchmen. Really great to hang out with this guy, always down to do something cool. Also, a bit of a view into the hostel I stayed at.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3752/12904691154_cc0f382a78_c.jpg" alt="Meet Nacho"><figcaption>This Nacho is from Argentina. To further some national stereotypes: you can tell because he's drinking from a mate gourd. He's hilarious, and I have plans to visit him towards the end of the trip.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2876/12822410245_1d8e5d449e_c.jpg" alt="Gato"><figcaption>I named her Barbara. She's a total sweetie, one of the softest cat's I've ever pet.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/12822412765_bc97486f31_c.jpg" alt="Curch in Loja"><figcaption>Had to go on a day trip to get a new battery, ended up in a church after lunch to duck out from a passing rain cloud. It was pretty glorious.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/12822479783_2b1794aa98_c.jpg" alt="Not In My House"><figcaption>&quot;No you didn't just sin, not in my house&quot;</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/12822482803_ac89e73517_c.jpg" alt="Candles and Jesus"><figcaption>So many Jesuses. I didn't manage to get a photo of a super gory Jesus because there were a bunch of people that looked really sad around him... But this Jesus was alone, and down for a photo shoot.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/12822485543_7023b912a0_c.jpg" alt="Scary People"><figcaption>This kind of creeped me out.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/counterbeing/sets/72157641627860704/show" title="The flickr set">the original files on flickr</a> in a slideshow.</p><br><div class="map-nav"><a href="#20140224_ecuador_cuenca" title="previous post" class="button scripty">&lt; Previous</a> <a href="#20140302_peru_san_ignacio" title="next post" class="button scripty">Next &gt;</a> <a href="/index.html" title="homepage" class="button">Homepage</a></div><footer>by Cory Logan</footer></div></body></html>
