# Cory Logan's Bits Blog

Uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator for a blog for me to store things that I'm learning about.

I'm using [docker-hugo](https://github.com/jojomi/docker-hugo) to run builds wherever I want.

```bash
# Will download the necessary things, render the page, and you can see the site
# at http://localhost:8181
docker-compose up

# To stop it
docker-compose stop
```
