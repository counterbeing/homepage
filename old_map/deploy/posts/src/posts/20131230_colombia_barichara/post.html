When Edgar told me they were selling ants I told him we had to buy some. He said &quot;okay&quot;, like I had just asked for peanuts. I didn't think it would trouble me much, but when I got them in my and and saw how big and juicy their butts looked, i was a bit scared... Anyway, I did eat them, but I can't say they were the best thing I've ever tasted.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/11652730864_983bc335b9_c.jpg" alt="Ant parts"><figcaption>I ate a few, but decided I wasn't ready for more.
