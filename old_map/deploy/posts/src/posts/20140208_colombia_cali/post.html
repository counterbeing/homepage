I wish I had gotten to spend some time checking out some of the salsa dancing while I was there. But one of the days I was there, was Sunday, and on Sunday there is nobody in town. Completely empty, walking around reminded me of the beginning of 28 days later. It felt deserted.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/12445655404_bf9591ba41_c.jpg" alt="Cali Traffic"><figcaption>I grabbed one sad snap on my way out of town, this was it.
