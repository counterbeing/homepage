So, I skipped out on Santa Marta, and headed for the hills.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have much time here, but I was happy to see it. The highlight was walking up to Hostel Casa Loma and checking out their view for a little while with a beer. I didn&#39;t initally realize I couldn&#39;t ride my motorcycle there somehow, but they&#39;re way up a hill.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/11239567183_3bda5aab63_c.jpg" alt="Macaws"><figcaption>I'm not a huge bird fan but these were pretty cool.
