    This is a project for synchronizing light displays across an improvised
    wireless network. They were used mostly in scarves and on bicycles, but
    [@100ideas](https://github.com/100ideas) and I are trying to design an easy
    to implement DIY project that will allow individuals to construct lights
    that will communicate with each other.

    This was a startup tool for advertisers to preview ads on various webpages.
    Many advertisers have to provide some sort of mockup of how ads appear on
    page. The problem this solved was automating the collection of up to date
    screenshots of ads on page.


    This was a fairly complex operation with a microservice architecture and a
    queueing system. It consistem of:


    - A thing

    - yep

    I worked with a group of super smart and driven folks to help build [Able
    Health](http://ablehealth.com/). We did a lot of pairing to work on complex
    health measures.


    We worked to provide health insights to doctors in an unheard of timeframe.
    Rather than running reports annually to determine how much money was owed to
    providers by insurance, we ran metrics every day to give up to date feeback
    on how providers were doing.


    Being a small team, we were all full stack developers. I spent a lot of my
    time working with docker and kubernetes. Probably most of my work was trying
    to use ActiveRecord to craft efficient and complex queries that fulfilled
    the needs of the health industry.

    I had a great experience with CloudPassage working on the core product.
    Eventually a lot of my job solidified around an internal tool I built to
    collect and version vulnerability content.


    I proposed and built a project that resulted in one of our first in-house
    microservices. The benefits included centralization, and reduced redundancy
    in tons of data processing.

    This was a tool that I decided I needed. I looked around at various
    applications that were intended for the purpose but was generally
    dissatisfied at the primitive templating.


    As a programmer, when you do something more than once, you begin to think of
    ways to automate it. This project began as that, but now I'm beginning to
    wonder if I'll be able to turn it into a sellable product.


    The initial goal was to create a super slick interface that revolves around
    real time updating of data by using Angularjs resources, as well as a live
    templating preview that includes all the functionality  of Handlebars. The
    flexibility within templates gives you conditionals and loops for writing
    templates that are robust, and completely reusable.

    This was a unique challenge, and a really fun project. I'm actually a
    partner with this company, and we've been having a blast making cool emoji
    for people to text with.


    This project involved some original thinking because we needed to find a way
    to distribute our emoji without there being a store that already existed to
    sell them. So, we had to create our own custom workflow to both sell, and
    use the product.


    I did everything from the coding for the rails app, to all of the
    infrastructure management, and server scaling.

    This project started with an aging filemaker database. The goal of the project initially, was just to make the old database work. But then we took a good look at what the organization really wanted, and it was more than FileMaker would reasonably offer.


    It wasn't long before we were working on a project that would allow the organization to collaborate on this piece of their business, as never before. They no longer needed a person to type and retyple the same thing over and over again. We used nested models to elinate loads of redundant work.

    Around the time of this project, I recieved a parking ticket at a paid meter. Instead of wasting the day trying to fight the ticket, I decided to create a system where the public could post complaints about parking tickets, along with officer badge numbers. I'm pleased to say, people are still using it and referencing it regularly.
