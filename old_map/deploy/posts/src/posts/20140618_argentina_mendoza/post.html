I initially had fears about the terrible weather that had passed through a few days earlier. But there was very little ice, and the snow was just on the sides of the road. Amazing what a couple of days of sunshine can do.</p><p>Mendoza itself, seems really cute. I&#39;d enjoy spending more time here, particularly to check out the wine scene, but right now I really just want to get a move on.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3878/14267893799_1f95d50b75_c.jpg" alt="Bombillas for Sale"><figcaption>You know you're in Argentina when you see a selection of bombillas being sold along with tools.
