<p>I'd decided that I'd had enough of partying in overwhelming heat, and that it was time for some mountains. So, I skipped out on Santa Marta, and headed for the hills.</p>

<p>I didn't have much time here, but I was happy to see it. The highlight was walking up to Hostel Casa Loma and checking out their view for a little while with a beer. I didn't initally realize I couldn't ride my motorcycle there somehow, but they're way up a hill.</p>
