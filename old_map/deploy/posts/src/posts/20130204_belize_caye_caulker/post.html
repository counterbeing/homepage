It&#39;s got cute little brightly painted houses on a sandbar of an island. But the thing that&#39;s most beautiful is the wildlife in the ocean.</p><p>There are some downsides to living on land too. You&#39;re pretty much fish in a bucket for people who want to sell you things, and that can get pretty annoying. The english here, isn&#39;t exactly english. I thought that being in Belize, it would be relatively easy to communicate with the locals, but no. It&#39;s perhaps harder than in a second language, because here, you both purport to be speaking the same language to begin with.</p><p>Anyway, Matt and I got some diving done while we were here, and it was lovely.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/11251180296_035d53f9ed_c.jpg" alt="Sunset"><figcaption>Out on Caye Caulker matt and I did some diving, and this was the view from our little hut on stilts.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/11251567093_356922f697_c.jpg" alt="Selfie"><figcaption>I left my motorcycle outside of Belmopan at a hostel in order to safely take a boat out to the Caye and meet up with Matt.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7416/11251510836_899719f704_c.jpg" alt="Mattisfied"><figcaption>Matt, looking satisfied about the color of the water.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/11251480725_59be675883_c.jpg" alt="Matt"><figcaption>Sneaking up on an old man.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/counterbeing/sets/72157638438223683/show" title="The flickr set">the original files on flickr</a> in a slideshow.</p><br><div class="map-nav"><a href="#20130203_belize_belmopan" title="previous post" class="button scripty">&lt; Previous</a> <a href="#20130206_belize_belmopan" title="next post" class="button scripty">Next &gt;</a> <a href="/index.html" title="homepage" class="button">Homepage</a></div><footer>by Cory Logan</footer></div></body></html>
