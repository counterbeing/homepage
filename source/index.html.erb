## What's Up With Me Currently
I'm just finishing up a motorcycle tour starting in San Francisco, California, and ending in Buenos Aires. It's been an unexpectedly long journey, but valuable to me.

Once this trip is done, I believe I will move back to San Francisco, at least for a while. You can check out the motorcycle trip on [the blog](/map "Motorbiking through South America, a travel blog."). 

#### Employment
I work a lot, mostly because I like working. I'm always looking for projects that interest me. 

To learn more about what I've done in the past, and what I plan to do [take a look at the professional section](/professional.html "Work related things.").

#### Contacting Me
At the top of this page, you'll find several options. Please pick whichever is easiest.
