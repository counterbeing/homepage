    This was a tool that I decided I needed. I looked around at various applications that were intended for the purpose but was generally dissatisfied at the primitive templating.  

    As a programmer, when you do something more than once, you begin to think of ways to automate it. This project began as that, but now I'm beginning to wonder if I'll be able to turn it into a sellable product.  

    The initial goal was to create a super slick interface that revolves around real time updating of data by using Angularjs resources, as well as a live templating preview that includes all the functionality  of Handlebars. The flexibility within templates gives you conditionals and loops for writing templates that are robust, and completely reusable.

    This was a unique challenge, and a really fun project. I'm actually a partner with this company, and we've been having a blast making cool emoji for people to text with. 


    This project involved some original thinking because we needed to find a way to distribute our emoji without there being a store that already existed to sell them. So, we had to create our own custom workflow to both sell, and use the product.  


    I did everything from the coding for the rails app, to all of the infrastructure management, and server scaling.

    This great design was done by [MM Design](http://www.mm-sf.com/ "Designers."), but then the project was passed off to me for coding, and CMS integration. I chose LocomotiveCMS, and have been very happy with it.

    This project started with an aging filemaker database. The goal of the project initially, was just to make the old database work. But then we took a good look at what the organization really wanted, and it was more than FileMaker would reasonably offer.


    It wasn't long before we were working on a project that would allow the organization to collaborate on this piece of their business, as never before. They no longer needed a person to type and retyple the same thing over and over again. We used nested models to elinate loads of redundant work.

    Around the time of this project, I recieved a parking ticket at a paid meter. Instead of wasting the day trying to fight the ticket, I decided to create a system where the public could post complaints about parking tickets, along with officer badge numbers. I'm pleased to say, people are still using it and referencing it regularly.
