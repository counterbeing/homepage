The descent from the mountains was too much fun to stop for a photo.</p><p>I was surprised at how nice Lima seemed. It was actually rather clean. Granted, I was in the nicest neighborhood as far as I know, but regardless, there were very few rough edges. I had some good food, and got on my way. I only wish I had made it to the San Francisco church.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/13589162894_56ec56a41e_c.jpg" alt="Distant Mountains"><figcaption>Just starting the trip to Lima.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/13589186334_8bab168e60_c.jpg" alt="Distant River"><figcaption>This way and to the right led me down a windy descent.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3766/13588827535_f76b1e82a6_c.jpg" alt="Half Way"><figcaption>Half way to the coast, the landscape was distant.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/13589211104_300ed51a9b_c.jpg" alt="Coastal Sand"><figcaption>At the coast was a road that looked like it was in such a loose pile of sand, I didn't understand how it didn't just fall down in the ocean, or get covered in sand from above.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7085/13589221994_b9aa1ede59_c.jpg" alt="North of Lima"><figcaption>Again I was amazed at the structures dug into the side of steep sand hills.
