I found <a href="http://www.hostalelarbol.com/">a nice hostel</a> to hang out at. Ate dinner, had a nap. Just when I thought nothing excitng was going to happen, which was perfect for a tired man, Jorge came and picked me up.</p><p>Jorge is a guy I met on the internet, because he had been considering buying my motorcycle. Anyway, Jorge showed me a great time. I went to meet his family, and then went out to a birthday thing of one of his friends. I ended up out later than I wanted to be, but I didn&#39;t regret it.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5151/14384647212_381e5ecdf0_c.jpg" alt="Helmet Head"><figcaption>At a stop light on the way out of town.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/counterbeing/sets/72157644684191029/show" title="The flickr set">the original files on flickr</a> in a slideshow.</p><br><div class="map-nav"><a href="#20140522_chile_copiapo" title="previous post" class="button scripty">&lt; Previous</a> <a href="#20140608_chile_valparaiso" title="next post" class="button scripty">Next &gt;</a> <a href="/index.html" title="homepage" class="button">Homepage</a></div><footer>by Cory Logan</footer></div></body></html>
