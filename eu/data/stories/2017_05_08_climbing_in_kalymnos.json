It turned out to be a good decision, I just put an album on and watched the islands go by.</p>\n<p>I was more than surprised to see just how beautiful the island actually is. I&#39;d only really seen pictures of gigantic tufa features in limestone caves high above the sea, which was all the motivation I needed to come. It was the sight of hills and the small colorful houses that dotted them that warranted a double take.</p>\n<h2 id=\"climbing-with-randos\">Climbing with Randos</h2>\n<p>Sheila headed back to San Francisco, leaving me without a climbing partner. So, I hopped on the <a href=\"http://climbkalymnos.com/bbpress/forum.php?id=6\">Kalymnos climbing forum</a> in search of a partner. I found a guy named Reid who I met for a beer. Before I&#39;d left the bar that night, I&#39;d met five other people all in a free form group of climbers. The same night, I went to a dinner to see one off. It seems like there is probably always a group of people here during the season, you just have to find them.</p>\n"
