There are a number of ways to make variables readable, and also to distinguish what variable types you might be working with. These things change from language to language, but it's nice to have a common set of vocabulary to refer to them. I find that I'm sometimes forgetful of how to actually refer to any given case, so here's a quick reference.

| Case | Example |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Snake Cases | snake_case |
| Camel Case  | camelCase |
| Pascal Case | Pascal Case |
| Kebab Case | kebab-case |

I've found that I often want to be able to switch from one to another, and that there's always a solution already in existence, the most helpful thing is knowing what to call it for the sake of googling.

It seems like I generally reach for these when doing some type of meta-programming.
