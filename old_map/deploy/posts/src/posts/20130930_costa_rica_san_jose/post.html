The last time I was in San Jose, someone had tried to mug me, so going back wasn&#39;t high on my priorities list, neither was sticking around for a while.</p><p>I discovered a fantastic place to stay with a relaxed, down to earth, and welcoming group of people at <a href="http://www.hostelbekuo.com">Hostel Bekuo</a>. In any hostel you go to, the different people make a different dynamic, but there are some hostels that seem to attract a certain type of person, and this seems to be one of those places, and in a very good way. I really enjoyed my time here walking around San Jose, or staying in and cooking and talking with other folks. An easy life for a while.</p><p>I also got the insider scoop on San Jose from my new friend Ericka. She was even good enough to introduce me to her friends, and take me on a weekend trip to Puerto Viejo. I had tons of fun, and my experience in San Jose would have been much shorter and less interesting without it.</p></section><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/11242395706_1c06cded70_c.jpg" alt="Happy Birthday Beer"><figcaption>Got to go out to dinner, and go see Ericka play some music on my birthday.
